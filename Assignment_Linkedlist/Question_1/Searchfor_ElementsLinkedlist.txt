Initiate at the Head: Start the search process by establishing a pointer at the head of the linked list. This pointer will navigate through the list.

Traverse the List: Use a loop to move through the linked list, node by node, until either discovering the target element or reaching the list's end.

Evaluate Each Node: At each node, compare the stored value with the target element being sought.

Continue Until Discovery or End: If the value matches the target element, the search is successful, and the iteration can stop. If not, proceed to the next node and repeat.

Manage End of List: If the list's end is reached without finding the target element, it implies the element is absent in the list.

Provide Outcome: Based on the search result, return either the node containing the target element (if found) or a message signaling the absence of the element in the list.

Conclude the Search: Terminate the search algorithm after locating the target element or reaching the list's end.

This iterative strategy meticulously examines each node in the linked list until encountering the target element or completing the list traversal, rendering it an effective and dependable method for linked list searches.
