Tracing the Bubble Sort Algorithm Step by Step for the Unsorted Array [6, 3, 8, 2, 5]:
Intermediate: Trace the Bubble Sort
Pass 1:

Start with the array [6, 3, 8, 2, 5]. Compare adjacent elements:

    Compare 6 and 3: Swap them as 6 > 3: [3, 6, 8, 2, 5].
    Compare 6 and 8: No swap needed.
    Compare 8 and 2: Swap them as 8 > 2: [3, 6, 2, 8, 5].
    Compare 8 and 5: Swap them as 8 > 5: [3, 6, 2, 5, 8].

After Pass 1: [3, 6, 2, 5, 8]
Pass 2:

Repeat the process for the remaining unsorted elements:

    Compare 3 and 6: No swap needed.
    Compare 6 and 2: Swap them as 6 > 2: [3, 2, 6, 5, 8].
    Compare 6 and 5: Swap them as 6 > 5: [3, 2, 5, 6, 8].

After Pass 2: [3, 2, 5, 6, 8]
Pass 3:

Repeat the process:

    Compare 3 and 2: Swap them as 3 > 2: [2, 3, 5, 6, 8].
    Compare 3 and 5: No swap needed.

After Pass 3: [2, 3, 5, 6, 8]
Pass 4:

Repeat the process:

    Compare 2 and 3: No swap needed.

After Pass 4: [2, 3, 5, 6, 8]
Pass 5:

No swaps needed as the array is already sorted.

After Pass 5: [2, 3, 5, 6, 8]

The sorted array is [2, 3, 5, 6, 8].
