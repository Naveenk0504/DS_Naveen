Bubble Sort Process for the Array [4, 9, 2, 7, 1]:

Pass 1:

Commence with the array [4, 9, 2, 7, 1]. Now, let's compare adjacent elements:

    Compare 4 and 9: Since 4 < 9, no swap needed.
    Compare 9 and 2: Swap them as 9 > 2: [4, 2, 9, 7, 1].
    Compare 9 and 7: Swap them as 9 > 7: [4, 2, 7, 9, 1].
    Compare 9 and 1: Swap them as 9 > 1: [4, 2, 7, 1, 9].

After Pass 1: [4, 2, 7, 1, 9]
Pass 2:

Continue the process for the remaining unsorted elements:

    Compare 4 and 2: Swap them as 4 > 2: [2, 4, 7, 1, 9].
    Compare 4 and 7: Swap them as 4 < 7: [2, 4, 7, 1, 9].
    Compare 7 and 1: Swap them as 7 > 1: [2, 4, 1, 7, 9].

After Pass 2: [2, 4, 1, 7, 9]
Pass 3:

Repeat the process:

    Compare 2 and 4: No swap needed.
    Compare 4 and 1: Swap them as 4 > 1: [2, 1, 4, 7, 9].

After Pass 3: [2, 1, 4, 7, 9]
Pass 4:

Repeat the process:

    Compare 2 and 1: Swap them as 2 > 1: [1, 2, 4, 7, 9].

After Pass 4: [1, 2, 4, 7, 9]
Pass 5:

No swaps needed as the array is already sorted.

After Pass 5: [1, 2, 4, 7, 9]

The sorted array is [1, 2, 4, 7, 9].
